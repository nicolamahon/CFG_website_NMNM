Code First Girls. Team Project - Website Development - www.FindMyRoomie.com

Code First Girls is a not for profit social enterprise with the aim to increase the number of women in tech. They offer free part-time coding courses for young women across the UK and Ireland.

As part of the course, I was involved in a team project to design and implement a website. The brief for the project only specified the web technologies to be utilised (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), after that all concepts and design decisions were left to the project team members.

Our project concept was for a student accommodation assignment service. Students attending any of the DIT campuses could apply to the service, which would match students with shared personal profiles, and place them into shared accommodations with similarly profiled students. Matches would be made by humans, not using any AI or algorithms. We pitched it as a "Daft meets Tinder".

The concept was born out of real life difficulties the team members experienced in moving to Dublin and trying to find accommodation that was both maintained to an acceptable, affordable standard and shared with like-minded roommates.

The website consisted of:
-	a mission statement and an overview of the services provided by the website.
-	an application form to allow potential interested parties to apply to use the service.
-	a contact us section, centred on our fake office location in Dublin City.
-	testimonials purporting that the services offered by the site were very successful and desirable, all fabricated by the project team!
-	links to social the companyâ€™s media profiles for Twitter and Facebook.

Functionality 
The site contents were held on a single webpage, with the use of anchors linked in the navigation bar at the top of the site, allowing the viewer to move around to the selected areas of the page. No server-side technologies were utilised in the implementation of the website as the project was a team effort, utilising the skills of beginner HTML team members, and it was decided that the design should reflect the collective skills of the group.

Google Forms were utilised to provide for an application form and a contact form. We also incorporated an embedded Google Map to bring some authenticity to our fake office location.

Overall the concept for the website we felt was an original one, and one our mentors showed great interest in. While the site itself was a project, we would consider it to be a good working model. To bring the service to life would require further development of services like a backend database to store user profiles and available properties. As well as being staffed with humans, who could assess applications and make matches between users and properties.

Currently we are waiting to find out if our project has won first place in the Code First Girls web development competition.
Fingers crossed!
